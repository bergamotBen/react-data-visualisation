## [Data Visualisation with React](https://github.com/bergamotBen/react-data-visualisation)

This two-day React sprint helped me learn about making API requests using Axios and presenting them using ChartJS. The data comes from the [National Grid's carbon intensity API.](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/) The API refreshes every thirty minutes and reveals that Scotlandâ€™s main source of power is (drumroll please) wind, again. Have a peep and see if itâ€™s changed. You never know.
